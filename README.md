K-Means clustering is the most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm. K-Means clustering is used to find intrinsic groups within the unlabelled dataset and draw inferences from them. In this kernel, I implement K-Means clustering to find intrinsic groups within the dataset that display the same status_type behaviour. The status_type behaviour variable consists of posts of a different nature (video, photos, statuses and links).
